                <h2>What is Model United Nations?</h2>
                <p>Model United Nations (MUN) is an educational simulation where students role-play as delegates to the United Nations and other international bodies. Participants research countries, investigate international issues, debate, deliberate, consult, and develop solutions to world problems.</p>
                <p>Through MUN, delegates enhance their speaking, debating, and writing skills, develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, and gain insight into the complexities of international diplomacy.</p>
